Epidemics

How can we model the contiguous diseases?

finding epidemic

- No choice 
- Invisible Process
	- Spreading of disease case.(More of the random proccess)

Entities
	Pathogen
	Network(dense or sparse)

Simplest Network 
	In form of tree
	
(BRANCHING MODEL)

First network model
	edge with prob of 0.5


Looking at many Levels
	if probabolity of infecting the neighbours is p
	then the expected numbers of the infected members
	is (p.k)

	for next level 
		EQN. would be:
		pk+pk+......upto pk times = (p.k)^2
	
	and so for the next levels

How Probablity and No. of neighbours determine ?
	R0(BASIC REPRODUCTIVE NUMBER) = p.k
	R0 < 1
		less than one secondary infection
	R0 > 1
		disease become epidemic

	R0 has knife-edge property

Realistic Model for the Observation
------------------------------------

	SIR Epidemic Model(Susceptible,Infected,Recovered/Removed)
		- terminal illness
		- non-terminal illness
